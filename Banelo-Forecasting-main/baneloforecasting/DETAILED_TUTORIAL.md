### ✅ Understanding Your Results

Look for these key metrics in the output:

**R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**
- 0.85-0.95 = Excellent ⭐⭐⭐
- 0.75-0.85 = Good ⭐⭐
- 0.60-0.75 = Acceptable ⭐
- <0.60 = Needs more data

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- Lower is better
- Compare to your typical daily sales
- If RMSE is 2.5 and you sell ~20 units/day, that's 12.5% error

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- Average prediction error
- In same units as your data
- If MAE is 1.5, predictions are off by ±1.5 units on average

### ❌ Common Errors

**Error: "No backend available" or "Runtime disconnected"**
- **Cause:** Colab session timeout or no GPU needed
- **Fix:** Click "Runtime → Restart runtime" and run again

**Error: "FileNotFoundError: sales_data.csv"**
- **Cause:** CSV files not uploaded
- **Fix:** Upload files again (Part C above)

**Error: "ValueError: not enough values to unpack"**
- **Cause:** CSV file might be empty or corrupted
- **Fix:** Re-export data (Step 1) and upload again

**Warning: "Low R² score (0.45)"**
- **Cause:** Not enough data or irregular patterns
- **Fix:**
  - Collect more sales data (wait 1-2 weeks)
  - Try XGBoost model instead
  - Still works, but predictions less accurate

### 💾 Save Your Work (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Click "File → Save a copy in Drive"**
   - Saves notebook to your Google Drive
   - You can reuse it next month for retraining

2. **Rename the notebook** (optional)
   - Click the title at top
   - Rename to: "Banelo_Forecasting_Nov_2025"

### ✅ Step 2 Complete!
You should now have `forecasting_model.pkl` in your Downloads folder.

- **Fix:**
  - Check internet connection
  - Try again in a few minutes
  - Check if Firebase is accessible: `ping firestore.googleapis.com`

**Warning: "Failed to sync 5 predictions"**
- **Cause:** Individual sync errors (usually data validation)
- **Fix:**
  - Check the error messages for specific products
  - Usually safe to ignore if most synced successfully

**Trend Indicators:**
- 📈 = Growing demand
- 📉 = Declining demand
- ➡️ = Stable

### 🎯 How to Use the Predictions

**For Critical Items (🔴):**
1. **Order immediately!**
   - Click product name to see details
   - Note the recommended reorder quantity
   - Add to shopping list

2. **Monitor closely**
   - These items will run out in 1-3 days
   - May need emergency orders

**For Low Stock Items (🟡):**
1. **Plan reorder for next 2-3 days**
   - Add to weekly order
   - Watch for usage changes

2. **Review trends**
   - If trending up 📈, order extra
   - If trending down 📉, order less

**For Healthy Items (🟢):**
1. **Normal monitoring**
   - Review weekly
   - No immediate action needed

2. **Plan ahead**
   - Note when they'll become "Low"
   - Schedule regular reorders

### 💡 Understanding the Metrics

**Current Stock**
- Your inventory right now
- Updated from products table

**Daily Usage**
- ML prediction of units consumed per day
- Based on 90 days of history

**Days Left**
- Current Stock ÷ Daily Usage
- How long until stockout

**Status**
- 🔴 Critical: ≤3 days
- 🟡 Low: 4-7 days
- 🟢 Healthy: >7 days

**Reorder Qty**
- Suggested amount to order
- Calculated for 30-day supply
- Adjustable based on your needs

**Confidence Score**
- How reliable the prediction is
- 90%+ = Very reliable
- 70-90% = Reliable
- 50-70% = Use with caution

### 📈 View Charts (if available)

Some implementations include:
- **Usage Trends Chart**: Shows past 30 days actual usage
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Compares predictions vs actuals
- **Stock Timeline**: When each item will run out

### 🔄 Retrain Model from Dashboard

If you want to retrain with new data:

1. **Click "Train New Model" button** on the forecasting page

2. **Wait for training** (2-5 minutes)
   - Progress indicator should appear
   - Don't close the page

3. **See updated predictions**
   - Page will refresh automatically
   - New accuracy score shown

Note: This uses the existing Linear Regression model in Django. For best results, retrain in Google Colab monthly.

### ✅ Step 6 Complete!
You can now view and use your ML predictions in the dashboard!

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

**Q: Predictions seem inaccurate**

A: Several possible causes:
1. **Not enough data**
   - Need at least 30 days of consistent sales
   - 90+ days is ideal
   - Solution: Wait and collect more data

2. **Irregular sales patterns**
   - Seasonal items
   - New products
   - Solution: Wait for patterns to stabilize

3. **Data quality issues**
   - Test sales not removed
   - Duplicate entries
   - Solution: Clean up sales data

4. **Model needs updating**
   - Sales patterns changed
   - Solution: Retrain monthly

**Q: Some products missing from predictions**

A: Check these:
1. Product has no sales history
   - Solution: Wait until product has sales

2. Product excluded by category
   - Beverages, water, etc. may be filtered
   - Solution: Modify filter in integration script

3. Database sync issues
   - Solution: Run `python sync_firebase_to_local.py`

**Q: Forecasting page blank/empty**

A: Troubleshoot:
```bash
# Check if predictions exist
python manage.py shell
```
```python
from dashboard.models import MLPrediction
print(f"Predictions: {MLPrediction.objects.count()}")
exit()
```

If 0, run:
```bash
python integrate_ml_model.py
```

**Q: "Days left" shows very high numbers (999+)**

A: This means:
- Product has no usage prediction (predicted_daily_usage = 0)
- Or current stock is very high
- Usually happens with:
  - New products with no sales
  - Inactive products
  - One-time items

**Q: Want to exclude certain products from forecasting**

A: Edit `integrate_ml_model.py`:
```python
# Around line 180, add filter:
products = Product.objects.exclude(
    category__in=['Beverage', 'Water', 'Ice']
).exclude(
    name__icontains='test'  # Exclude test products
)
```

### Performance Issues

**Q: Colab training takes too long (>30 minutes)**

A: Try these:
1. **Use smaller dataset**
   - Reduce to 60 days instead of 90
   - Edit `export_data_for_colab.py` line 32

2. **Reduce model complexity**
   - In Colab, change `n_estimators=100` instead of 200
   - Use Linear Regression only

3. **Check Colab resources**
   - Click Runtime → View resources
   - If RAM full, restart runtime

**Q: Integration script slow**

A: Normal if you have:
- Thousands of sales records
- Dozens of products
- Should complete in 2-5 minutes max

If >10 minutes:
- Check database isn't corrupted
- Restart Django
- Check system resources

### Firebase Issues

**Q: Sync fails intermittently**

A: Could be:
1. **Network timeout**
   - Retry in a few minutes
   - Check internet speed

2. **Firebase quota exceeded**
   - Free tier: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
   - Check quota in Firebase Console

3. **Rate limiting**
   - Too many requests too fast
   - Wait 5 minutes and retry

**Q: Can't access Firebase Console**

A: Verify:
- Correct Google account
- Project exists and not deleted
- Invited as owner/editor

### Data Issues

**Q: Negative predictions**

A: Shouldn't happen (code has safeguards)
If it does:
- Check for data corruption
- Re-export and retrain

**Q: All predictions same value**

A: Model didn't train properly:
- Retrain in Colab
- Try different model (XGBoost)
- Check feature engineering worked

**Q: Confidence scores all 50%**

A: Not enough data per product:
- Each product needs 7+ sales records
- Collect more data
- Or acceptable - predictions still useful
