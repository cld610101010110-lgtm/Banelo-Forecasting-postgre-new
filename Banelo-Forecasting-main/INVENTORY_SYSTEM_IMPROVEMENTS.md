# Inventory System Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive improvements made to the Banelo Coffee POS inventory management and forecasting system. The system now supports a dual-inventory model (Inventory A and Inventory B), waste management, and enhanced recipe management features.

---

## 🆕 New Features Implemented

### 1. **Dual Inventory System**

#### Inventory A (Main Warehouse)
- Represents the main warehouse stock
- Used for bulk storage and inventory management
- Products are transferred from here to Inventory B

#### Inventory B (Expendable Stock)
- Represents stock available for daily operations
- Used for processing orders in the mobile POS
- Can be transferred to waste when items expire or are damaged

#### Database Changes
- Added `inventory_a` field to Product model (Main Warehouse Stock)
- Added `inventory_b` field to Product model (Expendable Stock)
- Added `cost_per_unit` field for ingredient pricing

**Migration File:** `dashboard/migrations/0004_add_dual_inventory_fields.py`

---

### 2. **Inventory Transfer Feature (A → B)**

Allows administrators to transfer stock from Main Warehouse (Inventory A) to Expendable Stock (Inventory B).

#### How to Use:
1. Navigate to Inventory page
2. Select an ingredient product
3. Click the **"Transfer"** button
4. Enter the quantity to transfer
5. Confirm the transfer

#### API Endpoint:
```
POST /dashboard/api/inventory/transfer/
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "productId": "firebase_product_id",
  "quantity": 100.5
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully transferred 100.5 units to Inventory B",
  "newInventoryA": 400.0,
  "newInventoryB": 150.5
}
```

#### Business Logic:
- Validates sufficient stock in Inventory A before transfer
- Automatically deducts from Inventory A
- Automatically adds to Inventory B
- Updates the legacy `quantity` field to match Inventory B (for mobile POS compatibility)

---

### 3. **Waste Management Feature (B → Waste)**

Allows administrators to record waste from Inventory B and automatically log it to the waste_logs collection.

#### How to Use:
1. Navigate to Inventory page
2. Select an ingredient product
3. Click the **"Waste"** button
4. Enter the quantity to record as waste
5. Select a reason (Expired, Damaged, Spoiled, Contaminated, Other)
6. Confirm the waste record

#### API Endpoint:
```
POST /dashboard/api/waste/add/
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "productId": "firebase_product_id",
  "quantity": 25.0,
  "reason": "Expired"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully recorded 25.0 units as waste",
  "newInventoryB": 125.5
}
```

#### Waste Log Entry:
```json
{
  "productFirebaseId": "abc123",
  "productName": "Sugar",
  "quantity": 25.0,
  "reason": "Expired",
  "wasteDate": "2025-11-22 14:30:00",
  "recordedBy": "admin",
  "category": "Ingredients"
}
```

---

### 4. **Enhanced Recipe Management**

#### Ingredient Details in Recipe View
Each ingredient now displays:
- **Cost per unit** (₱ per gram/ml)
- **Current total stock** (Inventory A + Inventory B)

#### Recipe Card Display:
```
Ingredient Name                    Quantity
  Cost: ₱0.50/g    Stock: 1500g
```

#### Ingredient Dropdown Enhancement:
When adding or editing recipes, the ingredient dropdown shows:
```
Butter - Stock: 1000g - Cost: ₱0.3/g
```

This helps administrators:
- Understand ingredient costs when creating recipes
- Check stock availability before adding ingredients
- Calculate recipe costs more easily

---

### 5. **Available Servings for Beverages**

For recipe-based products (beverages and pastries), the system displays **available servings** instead of raw stock count.

#### How It Works:
- Calculates the maximum number of servings based on ingredient availability
- Takes the bottleneck ingredient (ingredient with lowest possible servings)
- Displays "Stock: X servings" instead of quantity

**Example:**
```
Latte Recipe:
- 20g Coffee Beans (available: 1000g) = 50 servings
- 200ml Milk (available: 5000ml) = 25 servings
→ Max servings: 25 (limited by milk)
```

---

### 6. **Inventory Display Improvements**

#### Product Cards Now Show:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Product Name           │
│  ₱ 150.00              │
│  Category: Ingredients  │
│                        │
│  🏭 Inv A: 500g        │
│  📦 Inv B: 150g        │
│  💰 Cost: ₱0.50/g      │
│                        │
│  [Transfer] [Waste]    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**For Beverages with Recipes:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Cappuccino            │
│  ₱ 120.00             │
│  Category: Beverage    │
│                        │
│  🧮 Stock: 45 servings │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔄 Order Deduction Logic (Mobile POS)

**IMPORTANT:** When processing orders in the mobile POS, always deduct ingredients from **Inventory B** first.

### Recommended Implementation (Mobile POS):
```javascript
async function processOrder(recipeId, quantity) {
    // Get recipe ingredients
    const ingredients = await getRecipeIngredients(recipeId);

    for (const ingredient of ingredients) {
        const needed = ingredient.quantityNeeded * quantity;
        const product = await getProduct(ingredient.ingredientFirebaseId);

        // ALWAYS deduct from Inventory B first
        if (product.inventoryB >= needed) {
            // Sufficient stock in Inventory B
            await updateProduct(product.id, {
                inventoryB: product.inventoryB - needed,
                quantity: product.inventoryB - needed
            });
        } else {
            // Insufficient stock in Inventory B
            // Option 1: Show "Out of Stock" error
            throw new Error(`Insufficient stock in Inventory B for ${ingredient.name}`);

            // Option 2: Fallback to Inventory A (if you want to implement this)
            // const remainingNeeded = needed - product.inventoryB;
            // if (product.inventoryA >= remainingNeeded) {
            //     await updateProduct(product.id, {
            //         inventoryB: 0,
            //         inventoryA: product.inventoryA - remainingNeeded,
            //         quantity: 0
            //     });
            // }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎯 User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Restocking Ingredients
1. Purchase ingredients from supplier
2. Add to **Inventory A** (Main Warehouse) via mobile POS or web interface
3. Transfer needed quantities to **Inventory B** (Expendable Stock) via web interface
4. Mobile POS uses Inventory B for daily operations

### Workflow 2: Processing Daily Orders
1. Customer places order in mobile POS
2. System calculates ingredient requirements from recipe
3. System deducts ingredients from **Inventory B**
4. If Inventory B is low, admin transfers more from Inventory A

### Workflow 3: Managing Waste
1. Admin identifies expired/damaged items in Inventory B
2. Opens waste management modal
3. Enters quantity and selects reason
4. System automatically:
   - Deducts from Inventory B
   - Creates waste log entry
   - Maintains audit trail

### Workflow 4: Recipe Management
1. Admin creates or edits beverage recipe
2. Adds ingredients with quantities
3. System shows real-time:
   - Ingredient costs
   - Current stock levels
   - Available servings calculation
